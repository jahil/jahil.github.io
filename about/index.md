I’m a Linux Engineer since 2002 with expertise in building and managing infrastructure (Open Source software) and Linux environments. I’ve broad experience in Debian, CentOS, Red Hat and SUSE Linux distributions and are certified for most of them as well (RHCE/LPIC-2).

## Specialties & Interest:

* Debian/Ubuntu, RedHat/Centos/Fedora, SuSE, Slackware, Gentoo, FreeBSD etc.
* Cloud: AWS, Rackspace etc.

This is another attempt for personal blog, where I share/archive my rusted thoughts and experience about amazing world of open source.
